## How to Use the Bot

### 1. Clone the Repository

Make sure you have cloned the repository to your local machine.

### 2. Edit the Configuration File

1. **Locate the `env-examples` File**

   - Find the file named `env-examples` in the repository. This file contains example environment variables required for the bot.

2. **Rename and Edit the File**

   - Rename this file to `.env` or another configuration file name used by your bot.
   - Open the renamed file in a text editor.
   - Look for the line starting with `DISCORD_TOKEN`.
   - Replace `your-bot-token-here` with your actual Discord bot token. For example:
     
     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your-actual-bot-token
     ```
